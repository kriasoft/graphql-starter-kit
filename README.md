### Getting Started

Just clone the repo and start hacking:

```sh
$ git clone -o graphql-starter-kit -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/kriasoft/graphql-starter-kit.git api.example.com
$ cd api.example.com
$ npm install
$ node server
```

Or, if you have [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) installed globally,
you can launch the server by running:

```sh
$ nodemon
```

The GraphQL server should become available at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
